When there are less numbers insert had the faster time, but once the numbers 
got to the thousands append begin to become quicker. In the append function 
it uses the .push method which adds a new element to the end of an array so it 
only has to give the new element a index thats greater than the of the last 
element of the array. In the insert function it use the .unshift method which
puts the new element in the beginning of the array, with that it gives the new
element a index of 1 but increments the rest of the array. The better of the 
two functions just depends on how big the array is. If the array does not have
to many elements then .unshift would work best, but not by much. If the array
has a large amount of elements then .push would save you a way more time rather
than .unshift.
